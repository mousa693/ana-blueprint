# ANA — Adaptive Neural-Simulation Architecture

This repository contains the technical system design for ANA.

ANA is an experiential AI architecture that models how identity and environment continuously shape one another through a recursive feedback loop. Instead of treating the world as neutral and the user as a passive observer, ANA treats identity as the primary generative input and the environment as its reflective output.

The document in this repository describes the full system architecture, including:

- Identity Core and Environment Mirror
- Recursive feedback and alignment protocols
- Memory shards and future-state backcasting
- NPC autonomy and entropy management
- World-truth harmonization and realism constraints

This is a design blueprint, not an implementation.
